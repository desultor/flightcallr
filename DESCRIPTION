Description: flightcallr uses the seewave package to generate acoustic
    measurements ("features") of sounds, and then trains and uses random
    forest models to make predictions based on these features. Accuracy
    can be constrained via cross-validation. Convenience functions for
    reading and writing Raven selection tables are included.
